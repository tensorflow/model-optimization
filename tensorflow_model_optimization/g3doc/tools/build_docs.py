"""Tool to generate open source api_docs for tensorflow_model_optimization.

To use:

  1. Install the tensorflow docs package, which is only compatible with Python

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/tensorflow/docs

  2. Install TensorFlow Model Optimization. The API docs are generated from
  `tfmot` from the import of the tfmot package below, based on what is exposed
  under
   https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/tree/master/tensorflow_model_optimization/python/core/api.

    See https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/install.

  3. Run build_docs.py.

    python3 build_docs.py --output_dir=/tmp/model_optimization_api

  4. View the generated markdown files on a viewer. One option is to fork
     https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/, push a change that
     copies the files to tensorflow_model_optimization/g3doc, and then
     view the files on Github.

Note:
  If duplicate or spurious docs are generated (e.g. internal names), consider
  denylisting them via the `private_map` argument below.
