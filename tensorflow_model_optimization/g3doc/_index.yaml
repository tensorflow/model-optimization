        The <em>TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit</em> is a suite of tools
        for optimizing ML models for deployment and execution. Among many uses,
        the toolkit supports techniques used to:
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px">
          <li>Reduce latency and inference cost for cloud and edge devices (e.g. mobile, IoT).</li>
          <li>
            Deploy models to edge devices with restrictions on processing,
            memory, power-consumption, network usage, and model storage space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable execution on and optimize for existing hardware or new special purpose accelerators.
          </li>
        </ul>
