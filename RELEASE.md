<!--
See https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/releases/ for previous
examples of release notes. This project follows https://semver.org/.

"Tested against" references the versions of TensorFlow that TFMOT unit tests
will be run against prior to release. For 2.X, only the earliest (2.0.0) and latest (nightly)
TF releases are tested against, under the assumption that everything in between
works sufficiently well enough.
