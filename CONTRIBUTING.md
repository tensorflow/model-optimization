# How to Contribute

progress and comment [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues/131).

## One-time Setup

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## TensorFlow Model Optimization Specific

### Style
Please refer to [TensorFlow's style guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/code_style). Don't forget to run pylint.

## Code reviews and pull request submission process

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests (PRs) for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Once the PR is approved by an appropriate OWNER and presubmit checks
pass, a reviewer will apply the `ready to pull` label to your change. This means
TF MOT is working on getting your pull request submitted to an internal
repository. After the change has been submitted internally, your pull request
will be merged automatically on GitHub.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/). Please also
look at the [TensorFlow contributor
guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute), in particular for the
community values.
