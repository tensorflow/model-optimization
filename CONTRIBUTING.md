# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.

Notably, we're working to make this project contributor-friendly. Please follow the
progress and comment [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues/131).

## One-time Setup

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## TensorFlow Model Optimization Specific

### Contributing Whole Techniques

See these [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING_TECHNIQUE.md).

### Other Contributions

There are two categories of PRs that are welcome:

1. All documentation fixes.

2. PRs for issues labeled with ["contributions welcome"](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22).
TFMOT considers these issues critical enough to fix (e.g. significant impact on user experience) and will provide basic guidance to volunteers. The list
is intentionally kept small. Prior to starting, it'd be a good idea to see if the issue is still important.

For other types of PRs, file a Github issue first, using an available template. If it makes sense
, we'll attach the "contributions welcome" label and assign you the issue.

Issues with a ["good first issue" label](https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)
are good for new contributors.

These guidelines seek to prioritize efforts that would benefit the community the most.
Feedback is welcome.

### Style and Practices
* Please refer to [TensorFlow's style guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/code_style). Don't forget to run pylint.
* For Colab changes, please refer to the [Notebook Formatting section](https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs#notebook_formatting) in the TF docs and run nbfmt after
any changes.

Unless agreed upon with the project maintainer in the issue or PR, the following are necessary to
merge a PR.
* Unit tests for behavioral changes. Keep in mind that unit tests that take a long time to run also make it harder to contribute.
* New features and major bug fixes, when ready to share with users, should come with a modification to the [release notes for the next release](RELEASE.md).
* Documentation changes for https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization, possibly making a note that something will only be available in the next release after X.Y.Z.
* Cleanup of commit history by [squashing noisy commit messages](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).

It is okay to not include all of the above in the initial PR, especially if early feedback is desired first.
