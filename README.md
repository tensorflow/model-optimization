# TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit

The **TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit** is a suite of tools that users,
both novice and advanced, can use to optimize machine learning models for
deployment and execution.

Supported techniques include quantization and pruning for sparse weights.
There are APIs built specifically for Keras.

For an overview of this project and individual tools, the optimization gains,
and our roadmap refer to
[tensorflow.org/model_optimization](https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization).
The website also provides various tutorials and API docs.

The toolkit provides stable Python APIs.
